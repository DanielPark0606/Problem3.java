- I expect to learn a lot about the process of coding and being able to implement and create projects using the programming language Java. If we have additional time, I would like to learn about creating software for android and mobile devices as I believe that specific discipline is interesting. Android development using Java offers versatile platform to create a wide range of mobile application, from simple apps to games and productivity tools.
